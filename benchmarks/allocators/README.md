BDE Allocator Benchmarks
========================

The ISO Working Group 21 paper On Quantifying Memory-Allocation Strategies
(N4468) and its two revisions P0089R0 and P0089R1 describe a set of strategies
for benchmarking the performance of memory allocators.  The benchmark results
contained in the paper are built on a port of BDE to clang 3.6, which is
available on a fork of this repository at
bde-allocator-benchmarks(https://github.com/bloomberg/bde-allocator-benchmarks).

The benchmark source code for all three papers is also included in
bde-allocator-benchmarks(https://github.com/bloomberg/bde-allocator-benchmarks/tree/master/benchmarks/allocators).
